Project Recipes

This project was started May 5, 2022 and is part of the introductory lesson from the Odin Project

The early lessons went over the basics of the internet: specifically how the internet is essentially just a wire and information is passed from clients to servers. Requests from the clients are sent to routers and then through Internet Service Providers (ISPs) help with getting information sent to the correct places.

Other lessons included:
-using the Terminal with MacOS Unix commands (to name a few):
    
    -ls : spits out the list of files or directories in the current location
    -pwd: present working directory
    -cd: change directory
    -cd .. : change to an upper directory location
    -mv file: moves files
    -touch file.txt: creates file in directory
    -mkdir dir: makes directory

-understanding the difference between Git and Github, where Git is an open-source software on your local device and Github is a remote, repository for these files
-understanding fundamentals for Version Control System (VCS)

-a guide for git commands:
    -git clone
    -git status
    -git add .
    #adds a file to the waiting room of changes before committing"
    -git commit -m "a quick message about the changes"
    #saves changes to local repository
    -git log
    -git push
    #pushes changes of the local repository to the remote repository

-setting up text editor (VsCode)
-HTML (hypertext markup language)
-CSS (cascading style sheets) fundamentals
